We are proud to announce the release of SAGE 1.0, a stable, responsive and
unrestricted SPARQL query server [1]. The software and an online demo are
freely available at: http://sage.univ-nantes.fr/

## Positionning

Compared to public SPARQL endpoints, SAGE is stable and responsive without
quotas.  SAGE is able to deliver complete results for any SPARQL query. The
Sage engine outperforms a Virtuoso server in term of execution time when
the server load increases.

Compared to the Linked Data Fragment approach, SAGE outperforms a TPF
server in term of execution time, communication costs and data transfers by
several order of magnitude by processing BGP on the server side.

Experimental results and more details are available in [1].

We encourage you to run complex queries on RDF datasets available on the
demo server and check performance (many presets queries are available).

We appreciate your feedback/comments/questions to be sent to our mailing
list [2] or our issue tracker on github [3].

On behalf of the Sage team,
