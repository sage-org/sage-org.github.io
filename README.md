Sage is a SPARQL query engine for public Linked Data providers that implements Web preemption. Thanks to web preemption, the Sage server has no time quota and ensures that SPARQL queries delivers complete results. SPARQL queries are suspended by the web server after a fixed quantum of time and resumed upon client request. 

The SPARQL engine includes a smart Sage client and a Sage SPARQL query server hosting RDF datasets. 


The complete approach and experimental results are available in a Research paper accepted at The Web Conference 2019. Thomas Minier, Hala Skaf-Molli and Pascal Molli.
